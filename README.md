# Sentiment Analysis of Tweets on Autonomous Vehicles

This repository contains the research and analysis conducted in our study on the comparative performance of various sentiment analysis models applied to the classification of tweets related to autonomous vehicles (AVs). 
Our work delves into a range of sentiment analysis models including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), BERTweet(base), RoBERTa(base), and RoBERTa(base-latest), with and without additional layers.

#### Objectives

The main objectives of this study were to:

* Evaluate the performance of different sentiment analysis models in classifying tweets about AVs.
* Compare the effectiveness of these models in multi-label and multi-class classification tasks.
* Assess the impact of augmenting models with additional layers on their performance.
